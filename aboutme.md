Hi, my name is <b>Thiago Felipe Bastos da Silva 🖖.</b>

Somethings that you can know about me:

- I'm a <ins>Software Developer</ins> 🧑🏽‍💻.
- I have experience programming in <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>Rust</b>.
- I love anime, and one of my favorites is called Code Geass.
- I play drums 🥁.
- I'm a big fan of Competitive Programming 🤓.

### My story 📖

I began my programming journey during technical high school in Systems Development at Colégio Pedro II, where I was introduced to competitive programming and programming marathons. This environment sparked my interest in C and C++, which I started learning early on.
<br><br>
During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at UFRRJ, I became even more involved in competitive programming, participating in contests such as Meta Hacker Cup, Google Code Jam, the SBC Programming Marathon, and Yandex Cup. To prepare for these competitions, I trained extensively on platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, and CodeChef, taking part in many contests and dedicating a lot of time to studying competitive programming techniques and algorithms.
<br><br>
In parallel, I also expanded my knowledge of computer science theory through research projects focused on graph theory. I had the opportunity to do this through two scientific initiation projects in graph theory: one funded by FAPERJ and another by CNPq, with a focus on a specific problem related to spanning trees.
<br><br>
Currently, I work as a C++ Developer at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio, working on a wide range of computer science problems.
