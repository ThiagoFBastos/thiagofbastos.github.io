### My story

I began my programming journey during technical high school in Systems Development at Colégio Pedro II, where I was introduced to competitive programming and programming marathons. This environment sparked my interest in C and C++, which I started learning early on.
<br><br>
During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at UFRRJ, I became even more involved in competitive programming, participating in contests such as Meta Hacker Cup, Google Code Jam, the SBC Programming Marathon, and Yandex Cup. To prepare for these competitions, I trained extensively on platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, and CodeChef, taking part in many contests and dedicating a lot of time to studying competitive programming techniques and algorithms.
<br><br>
In parallel, I also expanded my knowledge of computer science theory through research projects focused on graph theory.
<br><br>
Currently, I work as a C++ Developer at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio.
