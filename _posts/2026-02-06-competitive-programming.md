I started my journey in Competitive Programming when I was in high school, where I learned C and C++ and began solving problems on Brazilian platforms. At that time, I was only aware of basic programming competitions and had little exposure to more advanced topics in Competitive Programming.
<br> <br>
After starting my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, I delved deeper into Competitive Programming by discovering new platforms and practicing more consistently. During this period, I learned about Competitive Programming more seriously and became familiar with platforms such as Codeforces, AtCoder, and CodeChef. I also discovered major competitions like the ICPC, Google Code Jam, and Meta Hacker Cup. From then on, I learned a wide range of topics in Competitive Programming and participated in many online contests to prepare myself for the ICPC.
<br> <br>
I participated in competitions such as Google Code Jam and Meta Hacker Cup, and I qualified twice for both the first and second phases of the Brazilian ICPC. In my second participation, I placed 3rd in Rio de Janeiro and 29th nationwide in the first phase, and 13th place in the Brazilian Finals, competing against teams from different states across Brazil.
<br> <br>
Currently, I have paused my participation in online contests, but I still solve problems on online platforms, focusing on improving my skills in programming languages and deepening my knowledge of software development topics.
