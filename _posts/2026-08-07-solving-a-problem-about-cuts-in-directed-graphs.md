Today I wanna talk about a nice problem that I solved on [CSES](https://cses.fi/) known as [Critical Cities](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1703).
Summarizing, given a directed graph and a pair of source and target vertices, your task is to find out all vertices which belong to every path between them.

If we think more deeply and ignore that the graph is directed, we could think about articulation points, because they belong to every path given a pair of vertices, but we don't have an undirected graph and we need to think a little bit more.

Thus, you could think something like this: what if we get any path and, after this, in some way, we find out the cut vertices?

The answer to how we get such vertices is very simple: when we have a path between two vertices making a detour, i.e., those vertices are in the main path, but there exists another path between them, we can mark all vertices between them, except for them, and at the end we can filter only the unmarked vertices.

Why does it work? You could ask.

The cut vertices are never inside a path that could be bypassed by another path, because they belong to every path, so it isn't possible to use another route that doesn't visit them.

### The algorithm

```c++
#pragma GCC optimize("O3,unroll-loops")
#pragma GCC target("sse,sse2")
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using vi = vector<int>;
using ii = pair<int, int>;
using vii = vector<ii>;
int main() {
	ios_base :: sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);
	cout.tie(0);
	queue<int> S;
	const int MAXN = 1e5;
	vii G[MAXN];
	int n, m, lv[MAXN], p[MAXN][2], cnt[MAXN + 1];
	bool used[2 * MAXN];
	cin >> n >> m;
	for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
		cnt[i] = 0;
		p[i][0] = p[i][1] = lv[i] = -1;
	}
	for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
		int u, v;
		used[i] = false;
		cin >> u >> v;
		--u, --v;
		G[u].push_back({v, i});
	}
	S.push(0);
	p[0][0] = 0;
	p[0][1] = -1;
	while(!S.empty()) {
		int v = S.front();
		S.pop();
		if(v == n - 1) break;
		for(auto [u, k] : G[v]) {
			if(p[u][0] == -1) {
				p[u][0] = v;
				p[u][1] = k;
				S.push(u);
			}
		}
	}
	vector<int> path;
	for(int v = n - 1; v; v = p[v][0]) {
		used[p[v][1]] = true;
		path.push_back(v);
	}
	path.push_back(0);
	reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
	for(int k = 0; k < path.size(); ++k)
		lv[path[k]] = k;
	for(int v : path) {
		queue<int> Q;
		Q.push(v);
		while(!Q.empty()) {
			int u = Q.front();
			Q.pop();
			while(!G[u].empty()) {
				auto [w, k] = G[u].back();
				G[u].pop_back();
				if(!used[k]) {
					used[k] = true;
					if(lv[w] == -1) 
						Q.push(w);
					else if(lv[v] + 1 < lv[w]) {
						++cnt[1 + lv[v]];
						--cnt[lv[w]];
					}
				}
			}		
		}
	}
	for(int i = 1; i < path.size(); ++i) cnt[i] += cnt[i - 1];
	vector<int> C;
	for(int i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i) if(cnt[i] == 0) C.push_back(path[i]);
	sort(C.begin(), C.end());
	cout << C.size() << '\n';
	for(int v : C) cout << v + 1 << ' ';
	cout << '\n';
	return 0;
}
